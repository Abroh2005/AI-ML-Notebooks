        "In this project, you have to write a computer program to create an interactive game application called **Guess A Word**. The game must have the following major components:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. A repository of English words, their parts of speech and their meanings.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Another repository containing the player's name, the number of guesses made by them and the time taken (in seconds) to guess the words.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. A function to jumble the letters of the English words.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. A timer to calculate the total time taken by a player to guess the words.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Display a word such that its letters are jumbled, its part of speech and its meaning. Then prompt the player to guess the word one-by-one.  \n",

        "6. Check whether the player had guessed the correct word.\n",
